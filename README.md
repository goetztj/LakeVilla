# LakeVilla

This repository contains the artifacts of our LakeVilla paper.
It is structured as follows:
- YCSB-LH: submodule to the adapted YCSB benchmark for Spark
- Docker: A docker compose script to setup a Spark, HIVE, and MinIO environment similar to the one we used in our experiments
- LakeVilla: **coming soon**
