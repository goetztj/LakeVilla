# LakeVilla

This repository contains the artifacts of our LakeVilla (LV) paper.
We made use of [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to automate the deployment and reproducibility.
You will find the following content:
- YCSB-LH: submodule to the adapted YCSB benchmark for Spark
- Hive: all files needed for the hive docker container
- LV: all files for LakeVilla including binaries for the container
- Spark: all files for the Spark and Delta Lake container
- Spark-Iceberg: all files for the Spark and Iceberg container

## Usage
Simply call `docker compose` up to start all containers. More information will be provided soon.
